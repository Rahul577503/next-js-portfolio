In your Next.js project, you might have a `Layout` component that wraps your pages to provide consistent structure and styling. Let's explore how you can improve this `Layout` component for better usability and maintainability.

### Error Handling

One important aspect of component design is error handling. We should ensure that our `Layout` component gracefully handles cases where the `children` prop is not provided. This prevents potential runtime errors and improves the robustness of our application.

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
  {`
//components/Layout.tsx

import { ReactNode } from 'react'; 
import Navbar from './navbar'; 
import Footer from './footer';

type Props = {
  children?: ReactNode; 
}; 

const Layout = ({ children }: Props) => {
  if (!children) return null; // Error handling

  return ( 
    <div className="container">
      <Navbar /> 
      <main role="main">{children}</main> 
      <Footer /> 
    </div> 
  ); 
}; 

export default Layout;
  `}
</CodeBlock >
